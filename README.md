This is a rather simple [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) wrapper to make [zsh-git-smart-commands](https://github.com/seletskiy/zsh-git-smart-commands) compatible with omz plugins system.

## Install:
To install this plugin to your Oh-My-Zsh repo, run the following command:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/jelek21/omz-git-smart-commands.git \
      $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/git-smart-commands --recurse-submodules
```

## Usage:
Please have a look at [zsh-git-smart-commands](https://github.com/seletskiy/zsh-git-smart-commands).
There is further explainations on what this is about and how it works, and even
good examples of aliasses to make.

I did not add any aliases here on purpose, I do think aliases are a pretty
personnal thing that I should not force you to use or make...

## Good job!
You think I did a pretty good job?
I do not agree and think if someone did a good job in this repo it is
[seletskiy](https://github.com/seletskiy) so please do not hesitate to congratulate him!
